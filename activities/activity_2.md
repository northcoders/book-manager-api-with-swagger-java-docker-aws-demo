## ðŸ›  Building and Running

## ðŸ’¿ Exercise 2.1 - Installing Docker

In order to build and run Docker containers we'll need to install Docker.

Thankfully Docker provide installers for various operating systems.

Head over to their website and install **Docker Desktop** on to your computer.

**NOTE:** You DO NOT have to pay or sign up for any paid subscription to complete this lab. 

https://www.docker.com/get-started

## ðŸ’» Exercise 2.2 - Validating installation

Once you have successfully installed Docker Desktop you should be able to run various docker commands from the terminal

Have a go now and see if you can see your docker version by running the `docker --version` command.

You should see something similar to:

```
docker --version

Docker version 20.10.11, build dea9396
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Exercise 2.3 - Build your application

Before you dive into docker, we need to build the Java application.

We can use **Maven** to do this.

Open up your command line and navigate to the root of the project (where the pom.xml file is) and run:

```
mvn package
```

You'll see Maven build the application and it will create a JAR file in the **target** directory.

## ðŸŽ¨ Exercise 2.4 - Reviewing images

Let's have a look at the docker images you have on your computer.

```
docker images
```

If you don't have any images yet, you'll see something like this:

```
docker images

REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
```

## ðŸ§° Exercise 2.5 - Building your image

Now the exciting part, let's build your first docker image.

Make sure you are in the root of your project (essentially where the **Dockerfile** is located) and run the following command:

```
docker build -t book-manager-api:1.0 .
```

You should see Docker start to build your image. It might take a few minutes whilst it pulls down (downloads) the base images required.

Now try the `docker images` command again. Let's see if the image is there. You should see something similar to:

```
docker images

REPOSITORY         TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
book-manager-api   1.0       37b00ee85718   About an hour ago   371MB
```

## ðŸ§° Exercise 2.6 - Running your container

ðŸ™ˆ Ok so maybe this is the exciting part. Now that your Docker image is built, we can run it.

The docker tool allows you to build containers and also run them.

To run your docker container, run the following command:

**NOTE:** If you changed the **book-manager-api:1.0** part of the build command (step 2.5) then you'll need to update the command below:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 book-manager-api:1.0
```

All being well it should start up your Java application running as a Docker container.

- See if you can find out what the `-p 8080:8080` part of that command is doing?

<pre>

The **-p** part of the command stands for **publish** a container's ports.

Essentially this says forward ALL requests made on your computer to port 8080 on to port 8080 within the container.

By default, Spring applications start a server listening on port 8080.

## ðŸŽ‰ Exercise 2.7 - Accessing your application

With the container still running, open up your browser and go to:

[http://localhost:8080/api/v1/book](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/book)

You should see your application respond with the JSON for an empty array of Books.

You can also see some corresponding Swagger documentation

[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

## ðŸ›‘ Exercise 2.8 - Stopping the container

We can now stop the container.

To stop your container you can use the **Ctrl + C** combination and it will stop.

Head over to [Activity 3](./activity_3.md) and we look into deploying your container.
