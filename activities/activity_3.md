## 🖨 Configuring and Deploying your application

## 💿 Exercise 3.1 - Elastic Beanstalk deployment

Now its deployment time! We'll utilise [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) to deploy your application 🙌

Firstly lets just make double sure that you have built your application

Navigate to the root of your project and run:

```
mvn package
```

Next we're going to use that nifty Dockerfile to inform AWS how to deploy the application.

Have a watch of this video in order to deploy your application

## ☠️ Exercise 3.2 - Terminating the environment

Once you've basked (By basking we mean sharing some lovely screenshots on your cohort Slack channel 😍) in the success of deploying to AWS then its time to terminate your application.

Have a watch of this video in order to terminate the application.
